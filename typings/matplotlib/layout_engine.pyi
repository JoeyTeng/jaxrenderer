Classes to layout elements in a `.Figure`.

Figures have a ``layout_engine`` property that holds a subclass of
`~.LayoutEngine` defined here (or *None* for no layout).  At draw time
``figure.get_layout_engine().execute()`` is called, the goal of which is
usually to rearrange Axes on the figure to produce a pleasing layout. This is
like a ``draw`` callback but with two differences.  First, when printing we
disable the layout engine for the final draw. Second, it is useful to know the
layout engine while the figure is being created.  In particular, colorbars are
made differently with different layout engines (for historical reasons).

Matplotlib supplies two layout engines, `.TightLayoutEngine` and
`.ConstrainedLayoutEngine`.  Third parties can create their own layout engine
by subclassing `.LayoutEngine`.
"""

class LayoutEngine:
    """
    Base class for Matplotlib layout engines.

    A layout engine can be passed to a figure at instantiation or at any time
    with `~.figure.Figure.set_layout_engine`.  Once attached to a figure, the
    layout engine ``execute`` function is called at draw time by
    `~.figure.Figure.draw`, providing a special draw-time hook.

    .. note::

       However, note that layout engines affect the creation of colorbars, so
       `~.figure.Figure.set_layout_engine` should be called before any
       colorbars are created.

    Currently, there are two properties of `LayoutEngine` classes that are
    consulted while manipulating the figure:

    - ``engine.colorbar_gridspec`` tells `.Figure.colorbar` whether to make the
       axes using the gridspec method (see `.colorbar.make_axes_gridspec`) or
       not (see `.colorbar.make_axes`);
    - ``engine.adjust_compatible`` stops `.Figure.subplots_adjust` from being
        run if it is not compatible with the layout engine.

    To implement a custom `LayoutEngine`:

    1. override ``_adjust_compatible`` and ``_colorbar_gridspec``
    2. override `LayoutEngine.set` to update *self._params*
    3. override `LayoutEngine.execute` with your implementation
