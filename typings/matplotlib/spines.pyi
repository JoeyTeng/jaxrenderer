class Spine(mpatches.Patch):
    """
    An axis spine -- the line noting the data area boundaries.

    Spines are the lines connecting the axis tick marks and noting the
    boundaries of the data area. They can be placed at arbitrary
    positions. See `~.Spine.set_position` for more information.

    The default position is ``('outward', 0)``.

    Spines are subclasses of `.Patch`, and inherit much of their behavior.

    Spines draw a line, a circle, or an arc depending on if
    `~.Spine.set_patch_line`, `~.Spine.set_patch_circle`, or
    `~.Spine.set_patch_arc` has been called. Line-like is the default.

    For examples see :ref:`spines_examples`.

        Set the position of the spine.

        Spine position is specified by a 2 tuple of (position type,
        amount). The position types are:

        * 'outward': place the spine out from the data area by the specified
          number of points. (Negative values place the spine inwards.)
        * 'axes': place the spine at the specified Axes coordinate (0 to 1).
        * 'data': place the spine at the specified data coordinate.

        Additionally, shorthand notations define a special positions:

        * 'center' -> ``('axes', 0.5)``
        * 'zero' -> ``('data', 0.0)``
