        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            The output filename, e.g., :file:`mymovie.mp4`.

        writer : `MovieWriter` or str, default: :rc:`animation.writer`
            A `MovieWriter` instance to use or a key that identifies a
            class to use, such as 'ffmpeg'.

        fps : int, optional
            Movie frame rate (per second).  If not set, the frame rate from the
            animation's frame interval.

        dpi : float, default: :rc:`savefig.dpi`
            Controls the dots per inch for the movie frames.  Together with
            the figure's size in inches, this controls the size of the movie.

        codec : str, default: :rc:`animation.codec`.
            The video codec to use.  Not all codecs are supported by a given
            `MovieWriter`.

        bitrate : int, default: :rc:`animation.bitrate`
            The bitrate of the movie, in kilobits per second.  Higher values
            means higher quality movies, but increase the file size.  A value
            of -1 lets the underlying movie encoder select the bitrate.

        extra_args : list of str or None, optional
            Extra command-line arguments passed to the underlying movie
            encoder.  The default, None, means to use
            :rc:`animation.[name-of-encoder]_args` for the builtin writers.

        metadata : dict[str, str], default: {}
            Dictionary of keys and values for metadata to include in
            the output file. Some keys that may be of use include:
            title, artist, genre, subject, copyright, srcform, comment.

        extra_anim : list, default: []
            Additional `Animation` objects that should be included
            in the saved movie file. These need to be from the same
            `.Figure` instance. Also, animation frames will
            just be simply combined, so there should be a 1:1 correspondence
            between the frames from the different animations.

        savefig_kwargs : dict, default: {}
            Keyword arguments passed to each `~.Figure.savefig` call used to
            save the individual frames.

        progress_callback : function, optional
            A callback function that will be called for every frame to notify
            the saving progress. It must have the signature ::

                def func(current_frame: int, total_frames: int) -> Any

            where *current_frame* is the current frame number and
            *total_frames* is the total number of frames to be saved.
            *total_frames* is set to None, if the total number of frames can
            not be determined. Return values may exist but are ignored.

            Example code to write the progress to stdout::

        parameter.

        The required signature is::

            def func(frame, *fargs) -> iterable_of_artists

        It is often more convenient to provide the arguments using
        `functools.partial`. In this way it is also possible to pass keyword
        arguments. To pass a function with both positional and keyword
        arguments, set all arguments as keyword arguments, just leaving the
        *frame* argument unset::

            def func(frame, art, *, y=None):
                ...

            ani = FuncAnimation(fig, partial(func, art=ln, y='foo'))

        If ``blit == True``, *func* must return an iterable of all artists
        that were modified or created. This information is used by the blitting
        algorithm to determine which parts of the figure have to be updated.
        The return value is unused if ``blit == False`` and may be omitted in
        that case.

    frames : iterable, int, generator function, or None, optional
        Source of data to pass *func* and each frame of the animation

        - If an iterable, then simply use the values provided.  If the
          iterable has a length, it will override the *save_count* kwarg.

        - If an integer, then equivalent to passing ``range(frames)``

        - If a generator function, then must have the signature::

             def gen_function() -> obj

        - If *None*, then equivalent to passing ``itertools.count``.

        In all of these cases, the values in *frames* is simply passed through
        to the user-supplied *func* and thus can be of any type.

    init_func : callable, optional
        A function used to draw a clear frame. If not given, the results of
        drawing from the first item in the frames sequence will be used. This
        function will be called once before the first frame.

        The required signature is::

            def init_func() -> iterable_of_artists

        If ``blit == True``, *init_func* must return an iterable of artists
        to be re-drawn. This information is used by the blitting algorithm to
        determine which parts of the figure have to be updated.  The return
        value is unused if ``blit == False`` and may be omitted in that case.

    fargs : tuple or None, optional
        Additional arguments to pass to each call to *func*. Note: the use of
        `functools.partial` is preferred over *fargs*. See *func* for details.

    save_count : int, optional
        Fallback for the number of values from *frames* to cache. This is
        only used if the number of frames cannot be inferred from *frames*,
        i.e. when it's an iterator without length or a generator.

    interval : int, default: 200
        Delay between frames in milliseconds.

    repeat_delay : int, default: 0
        The delay in milliseconds between consecutive animation runs, if
        *repeat* is True.

    repeat : bool, default: True
        Whether the animation repeats when the sequence of frames is completed.

    blit : bool, default: False
        Whether blitting is used to optimize drawing.  Note: when using
        blitting, any animated artists will be drawn according to their zorder;
        however, they will be drawn on top of any previous artists, regardless
        of their zorder.

    cache_frame_data : bool, default: True
        Whether frame data is cached.  Disabling cache might be helpful when
        frames contain large objects.
