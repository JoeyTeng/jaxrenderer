"""
Routines to adjust subplot params so that subplots are
nicely fit in the figure. In doing so, only axis labels, tick labels, axes
titles and offsetboxes that are anchored to axes are currently considered.

Internally, this module assumes that the margins (left margin, etc.) which are
differences between ``Axes.get_tightbbox`` and ``Axes.bbox`` are independent of
Axes position. This may fail if ``Axes.adjustable`` is ``datalim`` as well as
such cases as when left or right margin are affected by xlabel.

def get_subplotspec_list(axes_list, grid_spec=...):  # -> list[Unknown]:
    """
    Return a list of subplotspec from the given list of axes.

    For an instance of axes that does not support subplotspec, None is inserted
    in the list.

    If grid_spec is given, None is inserted for those not from the given
    grid_spec.

):  # -> dict[Unknown, Unknown]:
    """
    Return subplot parameters for tight-layouted-figure with specified padding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fig : Figure
    axes_list : list of Axes
    subplotspec_list : list of `.SubplotSpec`
        The subplotspecs of each axes.
    renderer : renderer
    pad : float
        Padding between the figure edge and the edges of subplots, as a
        fraction of the font size.
    h_pad, w_pad : float
        Padding (height/width) between edges of adjacent subplots.  Defaults to
        *pad*.
    rect : tuple (left, bottom, right, top), default: None.
        rectangle in normalized figure coordinates
        that the whole subplots area (including labels) will fit into.
        Defaults to using the entire figure.

    Returns
    -------
    subplotspec or None
        subplotspec kwargs to be passed to `.Figure.subplots_adjust` or
        None if tight_layout could not be accomplished.
